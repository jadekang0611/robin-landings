          <b>Section 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</b>
          <p>
            When you sign up for or use Robin, we automatically receive your
            computerâ€™s internet protocol (IP) address in order to provide us
            with information that helps us learn about your browser and
            operating system. We also collect the personal information you give
            us such as your name, address, email address, jobs you are tracking,
            tasks, notes and any other information you provide us. If you
            upgrade to one of our paid plans, we collect payment information and
            details of your plan.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <b>Section 2 - CONSENT</b>
          <p>
            How do you get my consent? When you provide us with personal
            information to complete a transaction, we imply that you consent to
            our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. If we
            ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
            marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed
            consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no. How do I
            withdraw my consent? If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you
            may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued
            collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by
            contacting us at admin@myrobin.io.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <b>Section 3 - DISCLOSURE</b>
          <p>
            We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law
            to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <b>Section 4 - PAYMENT</b>
          <p>
            All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS
            as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
            effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
            Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of
            credit card information by our store and its service providers.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <b>Section 5 - THIRD PARTY SERVICES</b>
          <p>
            In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect,
            use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow
            them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain
            third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other
            payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in
            respect to the information we are required to provide to them for
            your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we
            recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand
            the manner in which your personal information will be handled by
            these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers may
            be located in or have facilities that are located in a different
            jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with
            a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service
            provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of
            the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities
            are located. As an example, if you are located in Canada and your
            transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United
            States, then your personal information used in completing that
            transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States
            legislation, including the Patriot Act.
          </p>
          <br></br>
          <b>Section 6 - SECURITY</b>
          <p>
            To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions
            and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not
            inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or
            destroyed. If you provide us with your credit card information, the
            information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL)
            and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of
            transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure,
            we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional
            generally accepted industry standards.
          </p>
